# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
I've used Tableau to do some analysis on NYC Citi Bike usage. However, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see further bike trip analysis.

## Results

This depicts number of riders in relation to duration spent riding. The implication is that many riders don't ride for long periods. Comfort, price, and intent are yet to be determining factors.

This illustrates some key takeaways: gender of riders; location of most rides; and the general age of riders.

This illustrates that most rides are during general workday commute hours, and during workday hours. One could infer that riders are commuters, or people just riding for activities during business hours.

Similar idea to the aforementioned analysis with corroborating evidence of male-dominating ridership.

## Summary
One of the most distinct discoveries from the analysis is the gap between male and female riders. In almost every aspect, males outnumber women in ridership. The time of day or lenght of ride are not really aiding factors in the knowlegdge gap. Clearly, marketing needs to target this demographic. 
The other observation is that many riders take short trips on bikes. This, compiled with the most riders seemingly being the most densly populated areas of an already densly populated city gives further thoughts. Riders may use Citi bikes with the intent of reaching short distances only, or perhaps it is considered a novelty to outsiders in tourist dense Manhattan. More data and analysis is clearly needed indeed. I think that more date or visuals on the local of bike stations would aid in determining some more reasons why Manhattan reigns as the busiest area for ridership. Also, more visuals on the bike routes would help to truly get an idea of the intent of ridership.
